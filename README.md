# Angular Components for Metrics Visualization

__"Legos for Metrics Visualization"__

This project provides Angular 4 components for displaying custom visual representations of time series data as charts.
It uses [D3](http://d3js.org) as its charting toolkit and tries to simplify creating advanced metrics visualizations
with Angular.io components

While designed for use in the Hawkular UI console, it is a general purpose, metrics charting library designed to work with any array of data as long as it can be transformed into a tuple of datetime/value pairs.

## About

Hawkular Charts is a direct result of wanting metric visualizations for the parent project:
[Hawkular](http://www.hawkular.org/) - _Open Source Monitoring Components_.
